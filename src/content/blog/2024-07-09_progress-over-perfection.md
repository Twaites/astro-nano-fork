It's only recently that I've realized how much perfectionism has stunted my growth and progress. In May, during the renewal process, I decided to check how long I've owned this domain. To my dismay, it's been **20 YEARS!**

With the help of the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://twaites.com/), I looked back to conduct a post-mortem on where I lost my enthusiasm and passion. At the time, I was using this website as a project portfolio and blogging over at [KrazyKory](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://krazykory.com/). From what I can pinpoint, a few things played a role in me abandoning those efforts a little over 15 years ago.

- **Parent's Divorce & College Life** - During my freshman year, while on spring break, I returned home to the announcement of my parents' divorce after 20+ years of marriage. Needless to say, I was devastated, and my world was flipped upside down. While this wasn't the sole reason, I look back and notice it did take some of the wind out of my sails. Another factor was college coursework and the distractions of normal college life. I noticed significantly less attention being given to those websites as I approached my junior year.
- **My Standards of Perfection** - I wanted to create "the perfect" website without knowing what that even looked like. I can find fragments of abandoned layouts in Photoshop, sketches in notebooks, and other ideas on my hard drive that I know would never have been good enough for me to release. Even when I settled on a [design](https://www.flickr.com/photos/krazykory/280438614/), I would instantly start working on a [new one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/krazykory/1942428885/). While all the design churn helped me master Photoshop, I also became an expert at creating "coming soon" pages and [teasing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/krazykory/395135856/) [designs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/krazykory/1356722169/).
- **Development & Design Loops** - The inability to settle on a design created a loop of constantly starting to code a design into a WordPress theme, stopping halfway through, then starting on a new design—rinse and repeat.
- **Comparison** - They say, "Comparison is the thief of joy." While I know this to be true in other parts of my life, it’s the main reason why my designs were never good enough. Full of youth and inexperience, I was comparing my designs to those of professional designers with multiple years of development experience. I was never going to succeed with such pressure and unrealistic expectations for myself.

### Incremental Development

Now that I understand the underlying issues that led to my lack of enthusiasm and passion, I feel that the incremental development model will prevent me from repeating the past. With enough years of experience and knowledge to see it in action at a professional level, I know it will offer just the right balance of progress, stability, and innovation. What this has looked like in practice so far:

1.  I settled on a tech stack and [framework](https://astro.build/).
2.  I found a theme I can build on. [Astro Nano](https://astro.build/themes/details/astronano/) is a great theme.
3.  I’ve customized it just enough to launch with.
4.  In the future, I plan on tweaking it while adding more content.

With this approach, I don't know if I'll answer [Theseus's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), but I do know I'm considering this Day 0, even though I’ve owned the domain for over 20 years. I'm more passionate than ever to begin this journey, and I hope you'll join me.
