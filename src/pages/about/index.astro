            I'm a tech addict who's been using computers for over 30 years. Yes, you read that rightâ€”<i>since before Windows 95.</i> Somewhere along the way, over 20 years ago, I taught myself HTML, PHP, MySQL, and enough Linux to probably qualify for a hobbyist LAMP stack certification. That early love of computers directed my path towards a Computer Science degree, which I've parlayed into a career as a software developer that has lasted more than a decade.

            I'm passionate about learning. You'll either find me staying up until 3 a.m. reading documentation about a new language or framework, or watching YouTube videos to try to understand the aerodynamics of rockets or laminar flow. My approach to this website will be to create a place where I can constantly experiment with the new things I learn.
